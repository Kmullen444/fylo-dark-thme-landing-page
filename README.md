- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Preprocessor language for CSS


### What I learned

This has been a very fun and interseting project to work on. While learning Sass
and using it in my first project was interseting, it was the accessibility issues
that I had and solve that feel like the most important things. Like making sure
when using a `<section></section>`to include a `aria-labelledby="pointing to a 
title tag"`. And having a **.sr-only** if, like in this project, I had an `<h2></h2>`
element that I need to hide but still need to use to label the seciton.

### Continued development

Continuing the use of Sass is somthing that I'm excited to learn and use more.
